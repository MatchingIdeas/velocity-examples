### Included Test Frameworks

The `velocity` package coordinates between test frameworks and provides a common structure for reporting test results.  Velocity by itself does not perform any tests.  This example app includes the following velocity-compatible test frameworks:

* [mocha-web-velocity](https://github.com/mad-eye/meteor-mocha-web) - A Velocity version of mocha-web.  Runs mocha tests in the Meteor context which is great for integration testing.
* [jasmine-unit](https://github.com/xolvio/jasmine-unit) - Runs jasmine unit tests out of the Meteor context.  Fast and good for smaller unit tests.
* [jasmine](https://github.com/Sanjo/meteor-jasmine) - run jasmine tests in the Meteor context - great for integration testing.
