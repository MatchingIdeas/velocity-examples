velocity-example
================

A leaderboard example with velocity configured with jasmine


### Installation

```sh
# clone the velocity-example repo and run meteor
$ git clone https://github.com/xolvio/velocity-example.git
$ cd velocity-example
$ meteor

```


### Included Test Frameworks

The `velocity` package coordinates between test frameworks and provides a common structure for reporting test results.  Velocity by itself does not perform any tests.  This example app includes the following velocity-compatible test frameworks:

* [jasmine](https://github.com/Sanjo/meteor-jasmine) - Easily run Jasmine browser integration tests and server unit tests.
* TODO - add more frameworks
